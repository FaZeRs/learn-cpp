# Memory Pools

Memory pools (also known as memory arenas) are a memory management technique that pre-allocates a large block of memory and divides it into smaller, fixed-size chunks. This approach offers several advantages over traditional dynamic memory allocation:

- Reduced memory fragmentation
- Faster allocation and deallocation
- Predictable memory usage
- Better cache utilization

## Features

- Fixed-size block allocation
- O(1) allocation and deallocation
- Thread-safe options available
- No memory fragmentation
- RAII-compliant implementation

## Example

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <memory_resource>

// Create a custom allocator using std::pmr
std::array<std::byte, 1024> buffer; // 1KB buffer
std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource pool{buffer.data(), buffer.size()};

// Use the pool with STL containers
std::pmr::vector<int> numbers(&pool);  // Vector using our memory pool
numbers.reserve(100);

// Add elements - they'll use our pool
for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    numbers.push_back(i);
}

// Custom class with pool allocation
class MyClass {
    int data;
public:
    MyClass(int d) : data(d) {}
};

// Vector of custom objects using the pool
std::pmr::vector<MyClass> objects(&pool);
objects.emplace_back(42);
```

## Implementation Details

The memory pool is implemented using the following key components:

1. A contiguous memory block that serves as the pool
2. A free-list to track available blocks
3. Fixed-size chunks to eliminate fragmentation
4. RAII principles for automatic resource management

## Performance Considerations

Memory pools are particularly useful when:

- You need frequent allocations and deallocations of same-sized objects
- Memory fragmentation is a concern
- Performance is critical and you want to avoid the overhead of `new`/`delete`
- You need deterministic memory allocation behavior

## Best Practices

1. Choose appropriate block sizes for your use case
2. Initialize pools with adequate capacity
3. Consider using separate pools for different object sizes
4. Use RAII wrappers for automatic memory management
5. Monitor pool utilization to avoid overflow

## Limitations

- Fixed block sizes only
- Cannot resize blocks after allocation
- May waste memory if block sizes are poorly chosen
- Total memory must be pre-allocated
