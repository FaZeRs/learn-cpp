# Adapter Pattern

![Structure](structure.png)

## Intent:
The main intent of the Adapter Pattern is to convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. It lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## Components:
Target: This is the expected interface that the client requires.

Adapter: This is the class that joins functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces. It holds an instance of the class it wraps and then provides the target interface by invoking methods from the wrapped object.

Adaptee: This is the existing interface that needs to be adapted.

## How it Works:
The Adapter Pattern involves a single class that joins the functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.

A real-world analogy: Consider you're in a foreign country, and you've only brought appliances that fit your country's power outlets. You can't plug in your device directly because of the mismatched socket. An "adapter" or "travel plug" helps you connect your device to the foreign outlet.

## Advantages:
Reusability: Allows reuse of existing functionality into a new environment without significant rewriting.

Flexibility: Provides flexibility in integrating new classes with old code.

Separation of Concerns: Segregates the interface conversion from the primary business logic of the program.

## Disadvantages:
Overhead: Introducing adapters can increase the overall complexity of the code, especially if there are multiple adaptations required.

Not Always Feasible: Sometimes adapting might not be possible if the existing code isn't designed with adaptability in mind.

## Use cases
1. **Legacy Code Integration**:
When you have old systems or legacy code that you need to integrate with new systems, the Adapter pattern can be a lifesaver. Instead of changing the legacy code (which might be risky or time-consuming), you can create an adapter to make it compatible with the new systems.

2. **Third-Party Libraries**:
When using third-party libraries or components, sometimes their interfaces aren't exactly what you need for your system. Instead of modifying the library (which might not even be possible if you don't have access to its source code), you can use an adapter.

3. **API Integration**:
Different services offer APIs with varying interfaces. If you want your application to work with different services, you can use the Adapter pattern to provide a consistent interface to your application, making it easier to switch between different providers or services.

4. **Replacing Components**:
If you're replacing one component of a system with another component with a different interface, you can use an adapter to make the new component fit without changing the rest of the system.

5. **Multiple Inheritance Alternative**:
In languages that don't support multiple inheritance, the Adapter pattern can provide an alternative. A class can inherit from one class and use an adapter to use the functionality of another class without inheriting from it.

6. **Evolution of Interfaces**:
Over time, software evolves, and sometimes this means changing an interface. If there's a need to maintain backward compatibility, the Adapter pattern can be used. The old interface will become an adapter to the new interface.

7. **Standardizing Interfaces**:
In large projects or organizations, different teams might develop modules with different interfaces. To ensure these modules can work together, you can create adapters to standardize their interfaces.

8. **Data Transformation**:
The Adapter can be used to convert data from one format to another. For instance, if a part of a system works with XML but another part works with JSON, an adapter can be used to convert between the two formats.

9. **UI Widgets**:
In graphical user interfaces, sometimes the provided UI widgets might not fit the exact needs of your application. Adapters can be used to modify or augment the behavior and appearance of these widgets without changing their source code.

10. **Device Drivers**:
Operating systems use adapters in the form of device drivers to communicate with hardware. The same generic OS calls can communicate with a wide variety of devices because each device has an appropriate driver (adapter) that translates those calls into device-specific operations.

##
The Adapter Pattern is especially valuable when working with legacy systems or third-party libraries where code changes aren't feasible, but interfacing with newer systems or standardized interfaces is required.
