# Facade Pattern

![Structure](structure.png)

## Intent:
The primary objective of the Facade Pattern is to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem or set of interfaces, thus acting as an entry point to the subsystem.

## Components:
Facade: This is the main class that clients communicate with. It knows which subsystem classes are responsible for a request and delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects.

Subsystem Classes: These classes implement the subsystem functionality. They handle work assigned by the Facade object and are not aware of the facade.

## How it Works:
The Facade Pattern involves a single class that provides simplified methods required by the client and delegates calls to methods of existing system classes.

## Advantages:
Simplicity: By introducing a facade, you can convert a complex subsystem into a simpler interface, which is easier to use.

Decoupling: It decouples the client from the complex subsystem, promoting subsystem independence and portability.

Flexibility: Allows for flexible architecting. If there's a change in the subsystem's classes or their relationships, you can adjust the facade without affecting its clients.

## Disadvantages:
Limited Access: While it simplifies, it also limits direct access to the subsystem in case advanced operations are needed.

Possible Redundancy: If the system is simple or if subsystems are frequently accessed directly, introducing a facade might be redundant.

## Use cases
1. **Legacy System Integration**:
When integrating legacy systems, there are often multiple complex interfaces that newer systems need to interact with. Using a facade can simplify these interactions.

2. **API Wrappers**:
When interacting with third-party APIs, a facade can be used to hide the complexities and nuances of the original API, allowing for easier use and better encapsulation of external dependencies.

3. **Complex Libraries and Frameworks**:
Some libraries and frameworks have intricate initialization and usage processes. A facade can simplify these operations, making it easier for developers to leverage the functionality without getting bogged down in details.

4. **Subsystem Organization**:
In large software systems, there might be subsystems with a multitude of interacting components. A facade can provide a single point of entry to these subsystems, making it easier to understand and use.

5. **Abstracting Platform-specific Code**:
If you're developing software that needs to run on multiple platforms (like Windows, Linux, Mac), you might encounter platform-specific functions or libraries. A facade can abstract away these specifics, providing a uniform interface irrespective of the platform.

6. **Reducing Dependencies**:
Clients that need to interact with a system might end up depending on many components of that system. Using a facade, these clients can reduce their dependencies to just one component—the facade itself.

7. **Improving Performance**:
If certain operations in a subsystem are frequently used in a particular sequence, a facade can encapsulate these operations into a single method. This can sometimes lead to optimizations and improved performance.

8. **Simplifying Configuration**:
In cases where a subsystem requires a multi-step configuration or setup, a facade can be used to hide these steps, exposing only a straightforward initialization method.

9. **Isolating Potential Changes**:
If there's a chance that the subsystem might undergo changes in the future, using a facade can insulate clients from these changes. As long as the facade's interface remains consistent, clients don't need to change.

10. **Improving Readability**:
Instead of having clients juggle multiple calls to a subsystem, they can make a single call to the facade. This simplifies the client's code and improves readability.

##
The Facade Pattern is especially beneficial in systems where there's a clear distinction between client and complex subsystem. It’s also helpful when you want to layer your subsystems or provide an entry point to various subsystems.
