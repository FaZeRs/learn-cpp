# Mediator Pattern

![Structure](structure.png)

## Intent:
The main intent of the Mediator Pattern is to reduce connections between multiple classes or objects by centralizing external communications. It aims to reduce dependencies among a set of system components, thus decoupling the system, which can simplify maintenance and reduce the complexity.

## Components:
Mediator: This is the interface that provides a unified communication protocol to components.

ConcreteMediator: An implementation of the Mediator interface. This will keep references to all components and facilitate communication between them.

Colleague (Component): These are the various system components that need to communicate with each other. They do not communicate directly but through the Mediator.

## How it Works:
Components communicate with each other only through the mediator.

When a component changes its state or requires an interaction, it notifies the mediator. The mediator then takes appropriate actions and might relay requests or data to other components.

## Advantages:
Decoupling: It ensures that objects don't communicate directly, which promotes loose coupling.

Clarity: Centralizes and simplifies complex communications and control flow.

Flexibility: It's easier to add new components or modify existing ones without affecting other components.

## Disadvantages:
Centralization Risks: The mediator object sometimes becomes overly complex, leading to a single point of failure.

Potential Performance Bottleneck: All communications are funneled through the mediator, which can become a performance bottleneck in intensive systems.

## Use cases
1. **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**:
If you have several components on a UI, like buttons, textboxes, sliders, etc., you might not want every component to know about every other component. A mediator can coordinate interactions between these components. For example, a change in a slider can update a value in a textbox.

2. **Chat Rooms**:
A chatroom is a classic example of a mediator. Multiple users send messages to the chatroom (mediator), and the chatroom handles broadcasting the message to all users.

3. **Air Traffic Control**:
An air traffic control system can act as a mediator between planes. Planes donâ€™t communicate directly with each other but rather send their intentions and positions to the air traffic controller, which coordinates safe paths.

4. **Workflow Engines**:
Workflow engines manage and coordinate the execution of various tasks. They can determine which tasks can run in parallel and which ones are dependent on others.

5. **Complex Game Mechanics**:
In multiplayer online games where several players and NPCs (non-player characters) interact in a complex environment, a mediator can be used to handle and simplify interactions between them.

6. **Middleware in Distributed Systems**:
Middleware, which provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system, can use the mediator pattern to facilitate communication between different software components or services.

7. **Event Management**:
When you have a system where multiple components can emit and listen to events, a central event manager (mediator) can help handle and route events efficiently.

8. **Smart Home Systems**:
In a smart home setup, where multiple devices like lights, thermostats, and security cameras interact with each other, a central home automation hub can act as a mediator, managing rules and scenarios like "if the security camera detects motion, turn on the lights."

9. **Colleague Interactions**:
If you have multiple systems that need to interact, but they shouldn't have direct dependencies on each other, a mediator can serve as a broker or intermediary to handle the interactions.

10. **API Integration**:
When integrating multiple third-party APIs, especially when they need to interact with each other, a mediator can be introduced to manage and decouple the integrations.

##
The Mediator Pattern is particularly useful when a system has many interacting components, and there's a need to manage these interactions in a centralized manner. It's essential, however, to ensure the mediator remains maintainable and doesn't turn into a "god" object that tries to do too much.
