# Prototype Pattern

Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

## Intent:
The primary intent of the Prototype Pattern is to create a fully initialized instance that can be cloned or copied to produce a new instance, rather than creating a new instance from scratch, especially when it's more expensive or complex.

## Components:
Prototype: This is the abstract class/interface that declares a method for cloning itself.

ConcretePrototype: An implementation of the Prototype, providing a method for copying itself.

Client: The client class that creates a new object by asking the prototype to clone itself.

## How it Works:
Instead of relying on subclasses or factories to create objects, the object, which is an instance of the Prototype, is asked to clone itself, producing a copy.

This approach allows for adding and removing products at runtime since a client can copy a prototype without being dependent on a specific example of the object.

## Advantages:
Performance: Faster instance creation by cloning compared to creating new instances, especially when initialization is expensive or complex.

Dynamic Configuration: Allows adding and removing objects at runtime.

Fine-grained Instances: Allows users to create more fine-grained instances than can be easily done with classes or factories.

## Disadvantages:
Complex Copying: For objects with complex references or properties, the copying process might become tricky and error-prone. Deep copying vs. shallow copying concerns arise.

Maintenance Overhead: Any changes to the Prototype class hierarchy or properties can lead to changes in the cloning process.

Hidden Costs: If not implemented thoughtfully, there could be unintended consequences or hidden costs associated with copying objects.

## Use cases
1. **Performance-Critical Situations**:
When creating a fully instantiated object is time-consuming and a performance bottleneck, but a copy (clone) operation is much faster.

2. **Unique Instances with Shared Data**:
When instances of a class have only a few combinations of state, and it's more efficient to clone a corresponding number of prototypes than instantiating the class manually each time.

3. **Avoiding Subclassing**:
In situations where classes are defined at runtime (like user-defined classes) or systems that avoid extra subclassing. By using prototypes, one can avoid the need for subclassing Creator classes in the application.

4. **Dynamic Loading**:
In systems that need to dynamically load classes into the application, the prototype pattern can be particularly useful.

5. **Complex Object Initialization**:
When an object requires a lot of time and resources to be initialized, and you anticipate needing multiple copies with the same or slightly different configurations.

6. **Database Operations**:
If you're pulling an object out of a database and it's an expensive operation, but you need multiple copies of that object, it's much more efficient to clone the object rather than re-query the database.

7. **Distributed Systems or Parallel Processing**:
When sending the full object would be resource-intensive, you can send a minimal prototype object to other systems or processing units, which can then locally produce the full-fledged objects by cloning the prototype.

8. **Undo/Redo Functionality in Software Applications**:
If you want to provide undo functionality in software (like graphic editors), you can use the prototype pattern to clone the object's state before a change. If the user wants to undo a change, you can revert to the saved (cloned) state.

9. **Dynamic Configurations**:
When system configurations are stored as objects and you want to temporarily override settings without affecting the original configuration.

10. **Maze and Game Level Design**:
The prototype pattern can be useful in games, for example, when creating complex mazes. One can prototype different types of rooms and then clone and combine them to build the maze.

##
The Prototype Pattern is especially beneficial in systems where objects have numerous shared configurations and only a few differences. It's important to ensure that the cloning process correctly handles all properties and references to avoid potential pitfalls.
